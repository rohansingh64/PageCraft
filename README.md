# PageCraft — Dynamic Content Builder

PageCraft is a modern drag-and-drop content builder that allows users to create and customize a personal webpage in real time. It provides a clean and interactive interface where users can add, arrange, and edit different types of content blocks easily.



## Overview

PageCraft is designed to simulate a lightweight version of tools like Notion or Webflow. It focuses on simplicity, usability, and real-time editing without requiring any backend.

Users can build a page visually by dragging components onto a canvas and configuring them instantly.


##  Features

- Drag and drop content blocks
- Multiple block types (Header, Text, Image, Markdown, Divider, Quote)

- Clean and minimal UI



## Block Types

- Header
- Rich Text
- Image
- Markdown
- Divider
- Quote

Each block has its own editable properties like text, alignment, color, etc.



## UI Layout

The application follows a three-panel layout:

1. Left Panel (Palette)
   - Contains draggable block types

2. Center Panel (Canvas)
   - Main editing area
   - Displays all blocks

3. Right Panel (Config Panel)
   - Shows settings for selected block



##  Core Functionalities
